Slide 1: Title Slide
- ResearchLab-AI
- Autonomous Multi-Agent Research System
- Automatically generated research workflow output

Slide 2: Problem Statement
- Research requires multiple complex steps:
  - Literature review
  - Experiment planning
  - Machine learning code development
  - Execution and debugging
  - Metrics interpretation
  - Paper and slide preparation
- These steps are time-consuming and require expertise

Slide 3: Motivation
- Automating research workflows increases productivity
- Helps beginners build ML experiments without coding
- Ensures reproducibility and consistency
- Ideal for education, prototyping, and rapid experimentation

Slide 4: System Architecture
- Multi-agent collaborative pipeline:
  - Researcher Agent → Literature
  - Designer Agent → Experiment plan
  - Coder-Executor Agent → Code generation + execution
  - Analyst Agent → Metrics + plots
  - Writer Agent → Paper + slides
- Orchestrator manages message passing and workflow control

Slide 5: Researcher Agent Output
- Literature insights extracted about the topic:
  - Foundations
  - Modern techniques
  - Future directions

Slide 6: Designer Agent Output
- Experiment parameters:
  - Dataset size, features, classes
  - Selected model (RandomForest)
  - Evaluation metric (accuracy)
  - Experimental steps

Slide 7: Generated ML Code
- Auto-built Python script
- Contains dataset creation, splitting, model training
- Fully runnable and reproducible

Slide 8: Execution & Logs
- Code executed automatically
- Logs recorded in artifacts/session_id/run_logs.txt
- No manual execution required

Slide 9: Results
- Accuracy obtained from experiment
- Observed performance summary
- Insights from metrics

Slide 10: Accuracy Plot
- Automatically generated bar chart
- Visual representation of performance

Slide 11: Limitations
- Uses synthetic dataset
