## Introduction
This research explores the topic of **{{topic}}** using an autonomous multi-agent system.  
ResearchLab-AI automatically generates literature insights, designs an experiment, produces runnable machine learning code, evaluates model performance, and compiles a complete scientific report.

The objective of this paper is to demonstrate an end-to-end AI-driven research workflow that operates without manual coding or analysis.

## Literature Review
The following papers were identified as relevant to the topic:

{{literature}}

This section summarizes foundational concepts, modern advancements, and related machine learning approaches based on the structured literature produced by the Researcher Agent.

## Methodology

### 1. Researcher Agent
Generates structured literature findings and topic summaries.

### 2. Designer Agent
Creates a full experiment plan including:
- dataset specifications  
- model choice ({{model}})  
- metrics ({{metric}})  
- hypothesis and design steps  

### 3. Coder-Executor Agent
Automatically generates Python ML code using scikit-learn, executes it, and records logs.

### 4. Analyst Agent
Processes the execution output, extracts metrics, and generates accuracy plots.

### 5. Writer Agent
Generates this research paper and accompanying presentation slides.
